    "A quantum computer is a type of computer that exploits the principles and phenomena of quantum mechanics to perform complex calculations otherwise intractable with classical computers. There are various physical systems (or technologies) currently being explored for use as qubits including photons, trapped ions, superconducting circuits and spins in semiconductors. Qubits, in these technologies, are realized as fragile quantum systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "One problem that is shared between all these technologies is the difficulty to adequately isolate the qubits from the external noise: a phenomenon that disrupts the qubits resulting in inevitable errors during quantum computation. Bits in classical computers, in this regard, are different as they are typically realized as the on/off states of transistor switches and represented by their voltage levels with billions of electrons involved. This robustness guarantees near-complete elimination of failures at the physical level.\n",
    "\n",
    "For quantum computers, there is no such inherent protection, as such, any quantum computer circuit model requires active error correction.\n",

However, there still remain complications that don’t allow a straightforward translation of classical codes to quantum codes.\n",

Naturally, this degeneracy seems to pose a problem, however it does not reduce the code distance. To see why this is the case, consider the single-qubit errors $Z_4$ and $Z_5$ for which the syndrome is the same, thus the decoder doesn’t possess sufficient information to differentiate between the two errors and will apply the same recovery operation in either case. We will assume that the recovery operation output is $\\mathcal{R} = Z_4$. Now, for the case where $E=Z_4$ the recovery operation restores the logical state correctly. For the case where $E= Z_2$, the recovery operation applies the operation $\\mathcal{R}E|\\psi\\rangle_9 = Z_4Z_5|\\psi\\rangle_9 =|\\psi\\rangle_9$ and this is true because is a stabilizer of $\\mathcal{S}_{[[9, 1, 3]]}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "The quantum error correction protocols aim to make possible the use of qubits in a reliable way, thus addressing one of the major obstacles in realizing full-scale quantum computers. However, there is a significant trade-off that needs to be considered: the protocols analyzed require a large number of qubits to operate effectively. This inevitably requires a greater computational load, along with the overheads inherent to quantum computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, issues emerge when creating quantum codes due to the no-cloning theorem, the need to address two types of errors, and the wave-function collapse. For the codes analyzed, the quantum information is distributed across an expanded spaces of qubits. Errors are detected through projective stabilizer measurements, whose outcomes are then interpreted to determine the best recovery operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, many challenges remain to be solved, both at the hardware and software levels, with progress in one area strongly influencing the other."
